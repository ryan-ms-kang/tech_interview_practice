'''
You are given a 2D array visits, where each element represents a user visit pattern to websites. Each visit is a list of two elements:

The first element is the userâ€™s name (a string).
The second element is a website (a string) the user visited.
The task is to return all the website patterns that are visited by at least three users. 
A pattern is a sequence of three websites that are visited in order by a user. 

For example, if a user visits websites in this order: ["a", "b", "c"], then the pattern is ("a", "b", "c").

Return the list of all distinct patterns (sorted lexicographically) that are visited by at least three users.
